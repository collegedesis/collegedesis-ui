This is the UI for [collegedesis.com](//collegedesis.com). It is served up with a node server and uses the API.

## Running Locally

You'll need to [install node](http://nodejs.org/) and also setup a
local version of the [API](http://github.com/collegedesis/api).
Working on setting up a staging API to use for development as well.

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt server
```
